#Disclaimer
Due to a busy schedule and heavy workload, Norma will not be updated as often as it could have been. Things will pop up and I'll take care of it when I can. Feel free to polish it yourself if you wish.

NOTE: [A more up to date theme](https://store.koken.me/themes/oxygen/examples) that grew out of Norma is available over at Koken's own site. Credit to everyone that was involved. 

#Norma
