Recommendation plugin for Koken
=================================

This [Koken](http://koken.me) plugin allows you to have a recommendation slider when a user scrolls to the end of a page, heavily inspired from the New York Times. The recommendation will be another random page or essay from your site depending on the template that the user is currently viewing. You can also set the slider to have static text instead of recommendation if you prefer.
